# MultilinearModel_diagnostic
(Matlab) Script to analyze multilinear models, doing diagnostic through several statistics

The idea is inspired from the book La_regression_dans_la_pratique.pdf. 
The script takes as input a set of explanatory variables X and a dependent variable Y, with the hypothesis that the mpdel is a multilinear regression.
