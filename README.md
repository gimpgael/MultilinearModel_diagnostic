# MultilinearModel_diagnostic
(Matlab) Script to analyze multilinear models, doing diagnostic through several statistics

The idea is inspired from the book La_regression_dans_la_pratique.pdf (Ricco Rakotomalala - Pratique de la Regression Lineaire Multiple - Diagnostic et selection de Variables). 
The script takes as input a set of explanatory variables X and a dependent variable Y, with the hypothesis that the mpdel is a multilinear regression.
